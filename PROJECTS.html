        <td>•	In this project (G+10, G+15, and G+20) storey RCC buildings have been chosen
and modeled with friction, visco-elastic and viscous dampers.<br>
•	Analysis of top storey displacement, inter-storey drift, base shear, and stiffness of the
buildings has been compared with original buildings.<br>
•	Damper has been chosen for improving the seismic strength of reinforced concrete
building.
